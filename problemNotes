Current App Issues

- SamplesProvider renders Exercise component before samples have finished loading in the browser
    therefor the beginning cadence is missed
- Abstract out the css animation from the MothButton component so it can be used on the 'replay question' 
    button for the dissabled property
- Have the question icon change color according to whether the scale tone pressed is the correct answer (have the
    logic change the classes on the component)
-
