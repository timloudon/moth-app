Current App Issues

- create a gitignore file that doesn't include the sound files and logic file in the repo
- Abstract out the css animation from the MothButton component so it can be used on the 'replay question' 
    button for the dissabled property
- Have the question icon change color according to whether the scale tone pressed is the correct answer (have the
    logic change the classes on the component)
- Develop the options/settings page:
    - Be able to choose the instrument sound
        (initally outside of the exercise, but then have the ability to change sounds within the exercise)
    - Be able to choose the cadence type and have this affect the cadence title
- User login and data storage
- Smart questions:
    takes user data about past performance and chooses musical questions based on strengths and weaknesses
- ML creation of music for exercises
    develop ML so that chord progressions and melodies are not pooled from a static list
